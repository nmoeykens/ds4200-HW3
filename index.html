    <h1>Quantum Mechanics</h1>

    <p>Quantum Mechanics is the study of particles that do not follow classical physics
         and is governed probabilistically rather than deterministically. The subject is mainly
         configured using extensive linear algebra and contains a lot of the same theories and applications
         that come from more general fields. Quantum computing is also a large part of the study of 
         quantum mechanics. This can be somewhat similar to classical computer science as there are 
         logic gates that decide algorithms and languages, but in the case of quantum mechanics, bits are represented
         by 2x2 matrices called qubits. A quantum system is often described by vector spaces which contain the relevant
         information about a particle. Interestingly, the position of a state can be represented by a 3d sphere, with 
         some combination of polar coordinates. Perhaps the most unique thing about quantum mechanics is that measuring
         a system will fundamentally change that system in some unpredictable way. This sounds like a problem, but is 
         actually the main reason why people and companies are trying to build a quantum computer. The fact that 
         measurements changes the state of a particle means that with entanglement, many things that are entirely impossible 
         in classical computers and physics now become possible.
